# 🔐 Cybersecurity Tip — 10 June 2025

**Tip:** Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

**Why:** Users and systems should only have the access necessary to perform their job. This reduces the risk of insider threats or exploitation from compromised accounts.

✅ Best Practice:
- Regularly audit permissions.
- Revoke access promptly after role changes.
