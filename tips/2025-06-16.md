# üîê Cybersecurity Tip ‚Äî 16 June 2025

**Tip:** Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical accounts.

**Why:** MFA adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password. Even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access can be blocked by the second factor (e.g., OTP, biometric).

‚úÖ Best Practice:
- Use app-based authenticators like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator.
- Avoid relying solely on SMS for MFA.
